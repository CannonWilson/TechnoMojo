# TechnoMojo Student Portal v1

---

Made by [@CannonWilson](https://github.com/CannonWilson). 
This is the first version of the student portal for the instruction
of web development at the Innovation Outpost in Amarillo, Texas. It
is fully operational and deployed on Heroku [here](https://technomojo.herokuapp.com). 
Updates will continue to be made to this application, but not in this repo 
(I am no longer involved with the project or working at the Innovation Outpost).

## Overview

This app uses a React frontend with an Express backend that communicates with a 
cluster in MongoDB Atlas to store student data.

Students can sign in with their assigned username and password in order to view
every module in the curriculum laid out in an accordion. Clicking on the name 
of a module will reveal every lesson in that module. The student can then 
click on the name of the lesson they wish to take. Then, a new view appears 
that shows all of the details for the lesson, as well as a Vimeo video to watch, 
a quiz to take, and a coding exercise to complete. An answer video appears after 
the quiz is finished and the code for the exercise is submitted.
